### Issue Reporting
When reporting issues make sure to:
* Provide the best description of problem you are having (include Screenshots if you want)
* Provide crash report file if you crashed (use pastebin.com)
* Have FML log ready if that will be needed
* Don't report crafting issues to mod developers. Report them in here, since I am the one changing recipes. So any recipe problems (crafting and unification) report to ME!

### Pull Requests
[Squash](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) them, and make sure they works

### Important for using dev configs

The DEV version was tested with Forge 1558.
